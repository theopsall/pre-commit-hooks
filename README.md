# Pre-Commit Configuration for Python Projects

This repository contains a pre-commit configuration tailored for Python projects. It integrates tools like `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, and `autoflake` to enforce code quality and style consistency.

## Description

This pre-commit setup is designed to streamline Python code formatting and linting processes. It ensures your code is clean, readable, and adheres to best practices before every commit.

## Installation

To use this pre-commit configuration in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Install pre-commit**:

   If not already installed, install pre-commit globally with:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. **Clone This Repository**:

   Clone this repository into your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theopsall/pre-commit-hooks
   ```

3. Copy Configuration to Your Project:

4. Install Hooks:
